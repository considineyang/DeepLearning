# What is a Neural Network

ReLu function : Rectified Linerar Unit -- Housing Price Prediction

input layer --> density connected neural --> outputs

Every input feature is connected to everyone.

given enough training examples with both x and y neural networks can figure out functions that accurately map from x to y.

It's useful in supervised learning incentives.  



# Deep Learning in Sepervised Learning



one type of machine learning  - lucrative 

online advertising     standard NN

photo tagging            CNN

speech recognition   RNN

machine translation  RNN

Autonomous driving  custom/complex/hybrid NN architecture





Standard NN Convolutional NN Recurrent NN 

Structured Data : in database

each of the features has a very well defined meaning 

Unstructured Data : audio image text etc

Speech recognition image recognition natural language processing on text 



the course will focus on structured data.
