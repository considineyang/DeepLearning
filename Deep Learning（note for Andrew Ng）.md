# What is a Neural Network

ReLu function : Rectified Linerar Unit -- Housing Price Prediction

input layer --> density connected neural --> outputs

Every input feature is connected to everyone.

given enough training examples with both x and y neural networks can figure out functions that accurately map from x to y.

It's useful in supervised learning incentives.  



# Deep Learning in Sepervised Learning



one type of machine learning  - lucrative 

online advertising     standard NN

photo tagging            CNN

speech recognition   RNN

machine translation  RNN

Autonomous driving  custom/complex/hybrid NN architecture





Standard NN Convolutional NN Recurrent NN 

Structured Data : in database

each of the features has a very well defined meaning 

Unstructured Data : audio image text etc

Speech recognition image recognition natural language processing on text 



the course will focus on structured data.

## Basics of Neural Network Programming 

## Binary Classification(二元分类)

3 64 * 64 matrices denote a picture in computer turn these pixel intensity values into a feature vector 

In binary classification, our goal is to learn a classifier that can input an image represented by this feature vector x. and predict whether the corresponding label y is 1 or 0.

that is whether this is a cat image or a non-cat image.

### Notation

A single training example is represented by a pair  (x,y) where x is an x-dimensional feature vector y is the label is either 0 or 1.

Your training sets will comprise m training examples

m : (x1,y1),(x2,y2)....
